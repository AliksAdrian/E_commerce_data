E_commerce_data project

This dataset contains informations about an online business and the comments the customers after they bought a product. 

My goal of this project is to highlight the distribution of the comments according to factors like, the moment it has been posted, the lenght of the comment, the language used, etc.

The projet was a training for making text analysis, notably throughout wordclouds

I give a further insight on the negativity or the positivity of the comment throughout wordclouds.

The dataset has been generated with IA as a train for deeper and more sophisticated project related to text analysis.
